            <p>Welcome to the Divine Magic Foundation! Our organization is dedicated to bringing hope, healing, and
                happiness to the lives of vulnerable individuals in our community. Since our establishment, we have been

                other individuals in shelters.</p>

                support to those often forgotten by society.</p>
