            <h1>About Divine Magic Foundation</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Divine Magic Foundation, where we make a difference through compassion and healthcare.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Divine Magic Foundation is dedicated to organizing medical camps for underprivileged people living in
                low-income societies. Our main goal is to spread awareness and provide free healthcare diagnosis to
                those in need.</p>

            <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
            <p>In many parts of the world, access to healthcare is a luxury that millions cannot afford. We believe that
                everyone deserves quality healthcare, regardless of their economic status. That's why we have taken it
                upon ourselves to reach out to underserved communities and make healthcare services accessible.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>We conduct regular medical camps in low-income areas, offering services such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Free medical check-ups</li>
                <li>Health education and awareness programs</li>
                <li>Distribution of essential medicines</li>
                <li>Referrals for specialized care when needed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Our team of dedicated healthcare professionals and volunteers work tirelessly to ensure that every
                individual we serve receives the care and attention they deserve.</p>

            <h2>Join Us</h2>
